  <h1> Drake's Experiences and Experience! </h1>
</title>

<body>
  <p> A whole lot of experience in a whole lot of everything...honestly, I've just had a diverse background in a lot of manual labor positions. Everything from cooking, to manufacturing, to construction.
  For the last seven years I've been in masonry construction and restoration, of which the last four years have been in a supervisory role (foreman), overseeing projects to completion and to standard.
  Along with a solid work background, I've added education through those years as well. First I got my BS in Marketing Management, then I got an Associates Degree in construction, and now I'm wrapping up
  an MBA with a concentration in Project Management. Along with education, I've added extensive personal knowledge endeavors...take this coding education for example.
